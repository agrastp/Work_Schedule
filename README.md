# Work_Schedule

## Description
In this application, you will find a work planner to type out your daily schedule.  With a few changes, it could be altered as a schedule for any purpose.  The schedule is for the typical work day from 9am-5pm. Enter in your todos for each hour, save, and it will be there when you open it later in the day.  It is color coded to indicate whether todos/events are in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).  Refer to the date and time at the top of the page for quick reference.  

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This can be used as a work schedule.  With very little changes to the code, it could become schedule for the home. Time could also easily be altered in the code for an earlier start or a later end to the day.
